4. Warranties. In executing this Deed in Lieu, Grantor warrants and covenants as of the date hereof and as of the recording date of this Deed in Lieu, and Grantee agrees in accepting this Deed in Lieu, as follows:

4.1 Grantor is the owner of the Property free and clear of all encumbrances except for encumbrances of record as of the date of this Deed in Lieu.

4.2 The consideration for granting this Deed in Lieu for the Property consists of Grantee’s covenant not to make demand or commence any action against Grantor or Bryce A. Mearns (“Guarantor”) for collection of the indebtedness under the loans secured by the Deeds of Trust (the “Loans”), as more fully described in the Deed in Lieu Agreement executed concurrently herewith by Grantor, Guarantor and Grantee (the “Deed in Lieu Agreement”). Nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to (i) release Grantor from any obligations to Grantee, (ii) preclude or otherwise prejudice Grantee’s right to proceed with a foreclosure action against the Property, (iii) or limit Grantee’s recourse against Grantor or Guarantor for other loans made by Grantee to Grantor or Guarantor.

4.3 The consideration for conveying the Property pursuant to this Deed in Lieu is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the Property and includes the fair and reasonable value of Grantor’s interest in the Property.

4.4 This Deed in Lieu is executed freely and voluntarily by Grantor, and not pursuant to duress or threats of any kind. Furthermore, it is executed and delivered in mutual good faith between Grantor and Grantee, is not made with the specific intention to avoid obligations owed to other creditors nor to grant any preference to Grantee over other creditors, and is not given with the specific intention of hindering, delaying, or defrauding any creditor, or to contravene any of the bankruptcy laws of the United States or any other applicable laws.

4.5 This Deed in Lieu is not given as security for the payment of money or indebtedness, or as security of any kind or nature, and is not intended to create an equitable mortgage. There is no agreement or understanding, oral or written, between Grantor and Grantee, or any other person, relative to a conveyance of the Property back to Grantor, or to a sale or conveyance to anyone else for the benefit of Grantor, or to any division of any proceeds realized from the Property by sale or otherwise. Grantor waives, surrenders, and relinquishes any equity of redemption or statutory rights of redemption that Grantor may have in connection with the Property and the Deeds of Trust.

4.6 Actual possession of the Property shall be surrendered and delivered to Grantee concurrently with the recording of this Deed in Lieu. Grantor intends the recording of this Deed in Lieu will vest the absolute and unconditional title to the Property in Grantee, and forever estop and bar Grantor, and all of Grantor’s successors in interest, from having or claiming any right, title, or interest of any nature whatsoever, either in law or equity, or in possession or in expectancy, in and to the Property or any part thereof. In this regard, and in reliance upon this Deed in Lieu and all of Grantor’s warranties and representations made herein, upon recording of this Deed in Lieu, Grantee shall be entitled to exercise and enjoy all of the rights, responsibilities, powers, and privileges associated with the Property, including, without limitation, maintaining and improving the Property as Grantee deems appropriate, selling the Property at such time and on such terms as Grantee deems appropriate, paying taxes and assessments levied against the Property, and otherwise acting with respect to the Property consistent with the quiet enjoyment and ownership thereof by Grantee.

4.7 Grantor represents and warrants that, during the entire period that the Property was owned by Grantor (including any period between the execution and recording of this Deed in Lieu),

<!-- PAGE 33 -->
4422474 Page 5 of 8 12/22/2014 02:27 PM Thurston County WA

the Property was never used for the generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, disposal, release, or threatened release of any hazardous substance, as those terms are defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §9601 et seq. (“CERCLA”), the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (“SARA”), other applicable federal, state or local laws, or regulations adopted pursuant to any of the foregoing. Grantor agrees to indemnify, defend with counsel selected by Grantee in its sole discretion, and hold Grantee harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, and liabilities resulting from a breach of this representation and warranty. This duty of indemnification arises concurrently with the execution of this Deed in Lieu and survives recording of this Deed in Lieu and subsequent transfers of the Property.

4.8 Grantor further warrants and represents that: (a) Grantor has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Deed in Lieu; (b) Grantor is not acting under the influence or misrepresentations of Grantee, Grantee’s agents or lawyers, or any other person; (c) the consideration given to Grantor by Grantee for this conveyance equals or exceeds the value of the right, title, and interest of Grantor in and to the Property; (d) Grantor has had the opportunity to be advised by Grantee to seek independent legal counsel of Grantor’s choosing; (e) there are no agreements, oral or written, other than those reflected in this Deed in Lieu and the Deed in Lieu Agreement, between Grantor and Grantee with respect to the ownership or possession of the Property; and (f) Grantor fully understands the terms and effect of this Deed in Lieu.

5. Non-Merger. It is the express intent of Grantor and Grantee that this Deed in Lieu shall not operate to extinguish or satisfy the indebtedness secured by, or in any way affect, the Deeds of Trust or the security agreements incorporated therein, and the Deeds of Trust shall not be merged into the fee title conveyed herein. The Deeds of Trust shall remain a lien on the Property. Although Grantee has agreed, upon recording of this Deed in Lieu, not to take any action to seek or obtain a personal judgment against Grantor or Guarantor for Grantor’s payment obligations secured by the Deeds of Trust, Grantee retains the right to proceed with foreclosure actions under the Deeds of Trust and any related security agreements against the Property on the basis of existing or future defaults under the obligations secured thereby in the event that a foreclosure is deemed necessary by Grantee for any reason, including to clear title to the Property of any existing or future encumbrances subordinate to the Deeds of Trust. Further, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit Grantee from pursuing any other security granted for the Loans.

6. No Assumption by Grantee. Grantee does not expressly or impliedly agree to assume or pay any contract balances, debts, liens, charges, obligations, or liabilities that relate or attach to the Property or any other liability of Grantor, arising prior to the execution of this Deed in Lieu.

7. Counterparts. This Deed in Lieu may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered together as a single instrument. Separate signature pages may be attached to this Deed in Lieu for recording purposes.

8. Effective Date. The effective date of Grantor’s conveyance of the Property to Grantee shall be the date upon which this Deed in Lieu is recorded in the records of Thurston County, Washington.
